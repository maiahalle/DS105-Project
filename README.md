# Twitter Birds of a Feather Flock Together: Analyzing American Legislator's Frequent Used Words in Tweets

## Motivations
### As the idiom "birds of a feather flock together" suggests, people of the same ideology, hobbies, and interests tend to stick together. Will this idiom ring true for American senators and repersenatives? To find out, our group analyzed the most frequent words used on Twitter in the past 30 days by all 535 Members of Congress. Will legislators from the same political party tweet similar words to each other? We predict that not only will legislators tweet similar words with their associated political party but Republicans will be more likely to tweet words like "family", "border", and "steal". This is because Republicans are traditionally known for their "family" values, borders and immigration is a key talking point for them, and the word "steal" is associated with right-wing conspiracies. On the other hand, we predict Democrats will frequently use "green" and "rights" because the Democratic party has been focusing their efforts on climate change and increasing rights for minority groups. With an increased polarization in not only Congress but in wider US society, the information we gather from Twitter is an important insight into what American legislators have on their mind and wether or not that alligns to the rest of their party.

# NOTES TO INCLUDE: [delete later]
## It is important to note that we decided to exclude "rt" because , while it would give us interesting information on how mant times a congressperson retweeted in a month, our project only focuses on the individual words of the tweet.
